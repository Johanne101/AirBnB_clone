* The HTML is ***HyperText Markup Language***, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
In other words, the text on a web page is “marked up” with these codes to give the web browser instructions about how to display the text.
which means that it is written with codes readable by a person without it needing to be compiled first.

<p>
HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write.
CSS is the styling of your page, the design. make sure to fix your HTML part before starting the styling.
Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.

What is an [element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) / [tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)<a name="element/tag"></a>
-------------------------
<p>
Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. An HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element.
The terms HTML *element* and HTML _tag_ are interchangeable
i.e. a tag is an element and element is a tag.
For simplicity's sake, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same thing __as it will define something on your web page__.
</p>

* Element : An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning.
  i. An element is the basic building block of HTML and is typically made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.
  ii. It can also contain attributes that defines its additional properties.
